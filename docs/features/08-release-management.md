# Release Management Features

**Category:** Release Management
**Phase:** 7
**Priority:** P1 (High Priority)
**Dependencies:** Features 1-17 (Complete Infrastructure)
**Status:** ✅ Feature 18 Complete | 🚧 Feature 19 Core Docs Complete

## Overview

These features establish release versioning, automate release processes, and complete the technical documentation package.

## Feature 18: Release Versioning System

**Status:** ⏸️ Planning
**Estimated Effort:** 3-5 days
**Owner:** TBD

### Description

Create a consistent and meaningful versioning system for firmware releases with automated tagging and release note generation.

### User Stories

#### Story 18.1: Define versioning rules

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Choose versioning scheme (Semantic Versioning recommended)
- [ ] Define version components:
  - [ ] Major version (breaking changes)
  - [ ] Minor version (new features, backward compatible)
  - [ ] Patch version (bug fixes)
  - [ ] Pre-release identifiers (alpha, beta, rc)
  - [ ] Build metadata (commit hash, date)
- [ ] Define version increment rules:
  - [ ] When to bump major version
  - [ ] When to bump minor version
  - [ ] When to bump patch version
- [ ] Define version persistence:
  - [ ] Git tags
  - [ ] Version file in firmware
  - [ ] Build artifacts metadata
- [ ] Create version file format
- [ ] Implement version embedding in firmware
- [ ] Document versioning in `docs/versioning.md`
- [ ] Get engineering lead approval

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Versioning scheme defined (e.g., SemVer)
- Version increment rules documented
- Version format standardized
- Version embedded in firmware
- Rules reviewed and approved

**Semantic Versioning Example:**
```
v{major}.{minor}.{patch}[-{pre-release}][+{build}]

Examples:
v1.0.0              # First production release
v1.1.0              # Added new features
v1.1.1              # Bug fix
v1.2.0-beta.1       # Beta release
v2.0.0              # Breaking changes
v1.3.0+20250115     # With build date
```

#### Story 18.2: Automate tagging and releases

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create release automation script
- [ ] Implement version bumping:
  - [ ] Update VERSION file
  - [ ] Update changelog
  - [ ] Create git tag
  - [ ] Push tag to repository
- [ ] Automate release note generation:
  - [ ] Extract commits since last release
  - [ ] Categorize changes (features, fixes, breaking)
  - [ ] Format release notes
  - [ ] Include known issues
- [ ] Integrate with CI/CD:
  - [ ] Trigger build on tag
  - [ ] Create GitHub/GitLab release
  - [ ] Upload artifacts to release
  - [ ] Publish release notes
- [ ] Implement release checklist
- [ ] Create release notification system
- [ ] Document release process in `docs/release-process.md`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Version bumping automated
- Automatic tagging works
- Release notes generated automatically
- CI/CD builds releases on tag
- Artifacts uploaded to release
- Release notifications sent
- Release process documented

### Version File Format

**`VERSION` file:**
```
MAJOR=1
MINOR=2
PATCH=3
PRE_RELEASE=
BUILD_DATE=2025-01-15
GIT_COMMIT=abc123def456
```

**Firmware version embedding:**
```bash
# In build script
VERSION=$(cat VERSION | grep MAJOR | cut -d= -f2).$(cat VERSION | grep MINOR | cut -d= -f2).$(cat VERSION | grep PATCH | cut -d= -f2)
echo "VERSION=\"$VERSION\"" > rootfs/etc/firmware-version
echo "BUILD_DATE=\"$(date)\"" >> rootfs/etc/firmware-version
echo "GIT_COMMIT=\"$(git rev-parse HEAD)\"" >> rootfs/etc/firmware-version
```

**Runtime version access:**
```bash
# On device
cat /etc/firmware-version
# Or
grep VERSION /etc/firmware-version
```
